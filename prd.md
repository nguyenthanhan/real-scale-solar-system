# 🌞 Solar System Simulation – Unified Specification

An interactive, realistic 3D simulation of the solar system, built with **React** and modern 3D visualization libraries. This document serves both as the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** and an **instruction set for LLM-based development**.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

- Simulate the Sun and 8 orbiting planets in 3D.
- Realistic orbits, planetary sizes, and colors (scaled down for visualization).
- Include rings for Saturn and Uranus.
- Fully interactive experience with camera control and planet info display.
- Each planet rotates on its own axis (self-rotation).
- Planets must have surface variations (not a single flat color) to show self-rotation visually.

---

## 💻 Technologies & Libraries

- **React** – component-based framework
- **React Three Fiber** – 3D rendering via Three.js in React
- **Drei** – helpers for React Three Fiber
- **GSAP**, **Framer Motion** – animation libraries
- **Tailwind CSS** / **styled-components** – styling

---

## 📝 Functional Requirements

### 1. Rendering & Layout

- Central Sun
- 8 planets with elliptical orbits (not circular)
- Planets sized proportionally to real-world diameters
- Consistent orbit alignment without drifting
- Accurate colors for each planet based on NASA data
- Planet surfaces must show texture or color variation to visualize self-rotation

### 2. Interactivity

- Click on planet → show name, size, distance, speed
- Orbit speed controlled via a **slider UI**
- Camera zoom & rotation (3D perspective)
- Planets must **rotate on their own axis** continuously

### 3. Performance & Usability

- Responsive layout for desktops
- Animation performance target: 60 FPS
- All libraries imported via CDN or modern bundler (e.g., Vite/Webpack)

## 🎨 Planet Colors (Based on NASA Data)

- Mercury: Dark gray
- Venus: Pale yellow
- Earth: Blue with white clouds
- Mars: Reddish brown
- Jupiter: Orange-beige with white bands
- Saturn: Pale gold with rings
- Uranus: Light blue/cyan
- Neptune: Deep blue

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Touch/mobile gesture support
- Detailed tooltips or modals
- Starfield or nebula background
- Toggle between scientific and artistic visual modes

---

## 📦 Developer Instructions (For LLM & Human Assistants)

- Use modular component structure (one component per planet).
- Planet movement must follow elliptical paths with mathematically precise calculations.
- Orbit speed should be adjustable in real time using the slider multiplier.
- Each planet must also rotate around its own axis (self-rotation effect).
- Avoid solid flat colors — use textures or dynamic materials to visualize planet spinning.
- Follow code best practices: clean, performant, and readable.
- Prioritize stability in orbit calculations (no drifting or path deviation over time).
